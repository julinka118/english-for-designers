## Thesis
This bachelor's thesis focuses on exploring reality in food photography. With the development of social networks, digital photography and new trends, food photography has become an integral part of our lives. The goal of this thesis is to find out and understand what strategies and tricks are used to create the perfect food picture. The thesis begins with the basic principles of how to photograph food and how these photographs are used commercially. In addition, I deal here with different methods and techniques of photography for individual sectors in catering, from which I later focused mainly on fast food. In the next part of the work, I focused on the history of food photography and the most important authors associated with it. Then I decided to focus on contemporary food photography and its various forms of presentation, for example in the media, advertisements, cookbooks, and especially on social networks. In the theoretical part, I used the main method of searching available literature regarding food photography and food styling. Further research was carried out on websites, where I searched for documents regarding historical and contemporary authors of food photography. The result of my bachelor's thesis is the provision of an insight into the issue of customer manipulation through food photography using food styling or fake food. I am working on finding out why this method of deceiving the customer is used today. 
The practical part of my bachelor's thesis consists of a set of photographs of food, in which I capture the reality of the food taken and subsequently transformed into the form that is presented to customers in advertising images. The method of this part was conducted through market research and examination of specific photos in comparison with reality. Practical research was carried out by purchasing individual products and comparing them in detail with 


## Voice and tone
My voice, tone and style

My voice
Sometimes I like my voice and sometimes I hate it. I like to communicate with another people, because I am not shy, and I don’t mind If I will say something wrong or true. When I was little I loved presentation, because I was main character in the class. Also, when I was teenager, I was presenting my cookbook in television or to the press. I was never nervous! Now Iam older and I hate presentation in class. I am always nervous, and I don’t know what to say next. I don’t like when people are watching me. But I have this problem with my voice only in presentation. When It is my turn to talk with people outside, I love to use my voice. 


My tone
My tone is always different. It depends, which people I am talking. With my friends and family, It is my normal high tone, but when I speak with people, which I don’t know I am shy and my tone is lower. When I have fun and I spend time with my favourite people, I am so loud. My mother told me, when I was little I was really screaming and always talking. She could heard me from big distance. Lot of people told me, that I look arrogant, but when I started talking, they knew I am not. My problem is, that I really care, what other people is thinking about me and I am trying to be someone else. But that is just not me. 

Professional
In work I tried to be kind and I think I look shy, but It is not true. I just don’t want to be rude and namyšlená. 


Style
I am very often using slang and emojis. When someone is not using emojis, I feel that they are angry at me. Sometimes I am speaking really fast and I don’t know, what I am saying. I am also really sarcastic, so people think I am crazy.

## More about me

I'm student of photography and I like to create new things. I have always been an extrovert and I like to communicate with people. I started my journey with a camera at the age of 13, when I got my first camera under the christmas tree. At the age of 16, I published my first cookbook and became more interested in professional photography. I photographed the second cookbook by myself, as I had more experience in food photography. Now I take pictures of food for cookbooks and on my blog. I like to take photos on my journeys, portraits, or product photos. 

In my free time I like running, baking, and cooking. I have my blog about food, where Iam writing my own recipes.

## Project 1

A cookbook published by Smartpress publishers was my biggest photography project. After a long search for a food photographer for my second book, I decided to photograph it myself. I learned everything about food photography at that time. I cooked and photographed 90 recipes for the book. I focused on colors and simple decoration to make the food look realistic. I didn't use any fake food. 

The final product is Kuchařka pro mě a moje tělo and now are printed around 5,000 books. The book was published in 2022 and it's available in every bookshop in the Czech Republic.

About the book...

Like many teenagers, I was looking for answers how to eat better. And I found a lot, because practically everyone has an opinion on nutrition, but only a few really understand this complex topic. When I was preparing this cookbook, I asked many experts and also the platform My Body is Mine, who helped me to answer this important questions about nutrition in an objective and sensitive way. But the book is primarily a cookbook. It contains 90 easy, tasty and vegetarian recipes. The cookbook for me and my body is intended for all those who are starting to take responsibility for their own nutrition. Cooking, shopping, planning, but also thinking about your own relationship with your body and food. The chapters are divided according to ingredients that are good to have at home, there is also a basic shopping list. All 90 recipes are described in detail so that everyone can understand them and be able to cook them themselves. The ingredients used in my book are cheap and available.

### Project 2

I made this work this year for my final thesis at my school. I really like to take pictures about food. My topic was focused on how the photos look before and after the shoot. Before the photo shoot, It is time for foodstyling and choosing a suitable decoration, which sometimes takes many hours. I need good lights, composition and nice dishes. After the photo is taken it's time to eat the food and it takes only few minutes to ruin the setup and everything. I like to work with bright colours and lot of decorations. But It looks nice and simply.
