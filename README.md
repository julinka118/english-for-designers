## About

Hello, my name is Julie!

I'm a photographer based in Prague, but I'm open to take picture anywhere you want.

Photography and travelling around the world are my passion, and I am happy to capture things that are fascinating me. My favorite is taking pictures of food, because I want to work in food industry.

## More about me

I'm student of photography and I like to create new things. I have always been an extrovert and I like to communicate with people. I started my journey with a camera at the age of 13, when I got my first camera under the christmas tree. At the age of 16, I published my first cookbook and became more interested in professional photography. I photographed the second cookbook by myself, as I had more experience in food photography. Now I take pictures of food for cookbooks and on my blog. I like to take photos on my journeys, portraits, or product photos. 

In my free time I like running, baking, and cooking. I have my blog about food, where Iam writing my own recipes.

## Project 1

A cookbook published by Smartpress publishers was my biggest photography project. After a long search for a food photographer for my second book, I decided to photograph it myself. I learned everything about food photography at that time. I cooked and photographed 90 recipes for the book. I focused on colors and simple decoration to make the food look realistic. I didn't use any fake food. 

The final product is Kuchařka pro mě a moje tělo and now are printed around 5,000 books. The book was published in 2022 and it's available in every bookshop in the Czech Republic.

About the book...

Like many teenagers, I was looking for answers how to eat better. And I found a lot, because practically everyone has an opinion on nutrition, but only a few really understand this complex topic. When I was preparing this cookbook, I asked many experts and also the platform My Body is Mine, who helped me to answer this important questions about nutrition in an objective and sensitive way. But the book is primarily a cookbook. It contains 90 easy, tasty and vegetarian recipes. The cookbook for me and my body is intended for all those who are starting to take responsibility for their own nutrition. Cooking, shopping, planning, but also thinking about your own relationship with your body and food. The chapters are divided according to ingredients that are good to have at home, there is also a basic shopping list. All 90 recipes are described in detail so that everyone can understand them and be able to cook them themselves. The ingredients used in my book are cheap and available.

### Project 2

I made this work this year for my final thesis at my school. I really like to take pictures about food. My topic was focused on how the photos look before and after the shoot. Before the photo shoot, It is time for foodstyling and choosing a suitable decoration, which sometimes takes many hours. I need good lights, composition and nice dishes. After the photo is taken it's time to eat the food and it takes only few minutes to ruin the setup and everything. I like to work with bright colours and lot of decorations. But It looks nice and simply.
